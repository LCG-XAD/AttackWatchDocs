### ü™≤ Fixed (Bugs):

-   [AW-31](https://lcg-xad.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/AW/boards/7?selectedIssue=AW-31 'AW-31'): Fixed issue where submitting the first feedback required changing the type first when selecting "Ask a Question". The bug was found in the new feedback modal created in AW-15. The "Ask a Question" option would be locked unless another type was selected first. To fix this, we added a default label 'Choose one'.

-   [AW-47](https://lcg-xad.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/AW/boards/7?selectedIssue=AW-47 'AW-47'): Fixed an issue where the new translation feature caused the 'faker' functionality in .sh files to stop working. Due to the new translation feature in AW-28, the 'faker' functionality in .sh files stopped working.

-   [AW-48](https://lcg-xad.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/AW/boards/7?selectedIssue=AW-48 'AW-48'): A bug was found during the initial AttackWatch setup. AttackWatch raises an error when trying to create the first user of the Webserver due to the new log validations in AW-17.
