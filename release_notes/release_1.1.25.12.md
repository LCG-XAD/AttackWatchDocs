-   [AW-17](https://lcg-xad.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/AW/boards/7?selectedIssue=AW-17 'AW-17'): Implemented a new Activity Logger in AttackWatch. It records all created, modified, and deleted data, as well as sent emails and requests.

-   [AW-28](https://lcg-xad.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/AW/boards/7?selectedIssue=AW-28 'AW-28'): Enabled multi-language support for AttackWatch. We added a button to switch between supported languages in the interface. We implemented a new translation system inside AttackWatch and created its translations.

-   [AW-29](https://lcg-xad.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/AW/boards/7?selectedIssue=AW-29 'AW-29'): We improved the AttackWatch dashboard for compromised accounts by updating the labels. We replaced the "Last Month Compromised Accounts" with the "Total Compromised Accounts" metric.

-   [AW-49](https://lcg-xad.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/AW/boards/7?selectedIssue=AW-49 'AW-49'): Added web server release notes to the footer. This release note allows users to see which version of AttackWatch is currently running.

### ü™≤ Fixed (Bugs):

-   [AW-31](https://lcg-xad.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/AW/boards/7?selectedIssue=AW-31 'AW-31'): Fixed issue where submitting the first feedback required changing the type first when selecting "Ask a Question". A bug was found in the new feedback modal created in AW-15. The "Ask a Question" option would be locked unless another type was selected first. To fix this, we added a default label 'Choose one'.

-   [AW-47](https://lcg-xad.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/AW/boards/7?selectedIssue=AW-47 'AW-47'): Fixed an issue where the new translation feature caused the 'faker' functionality in .sh files to stop working. Due to the new translation feature in AW-28, the 'faker' functionality in .sh files stopped working.

-   [AW-48](https://lcg-xad.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/AW/boards/7?selectedIssue=AW-48 'AW-48'): A bug was found during the initial AttackWatch setup. AttackWatch raises an error when trying to create the first user of the Webserver due to the new log validations in AW-17.
